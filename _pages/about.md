I am a postdoctoral research fellow at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medical image analysis. 
I am dedicated to designing machine learning algorithms for biomedical data analysis, with a primary focus on medical images.

I obtained my PH.D. degree in Zhejiang University in July 2021. If you are interested in doing research with me, please send me an email.
