{% note success %}
To install igl in the latest Ubuntu, many tutorials pointed out to compile openResource by yourself. 
I tried to install all directly using `apt install ` or `apt-get install`, it worked in Ubuntu 18.04.
{% endnote %}

### Dependency Libraries
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev geomview
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install binutils-gold
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential  
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
sudo apt-get install libmetis-dev libmetis5 
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
```
### cmake-gui
If 'CoMISo' has error, cancel the 'build with CoMISo' in cmake-gui.

### GLFW
``` bash
sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev #The RandR library and headers were not found
sudo apt-get install libxi-dev #The XInput library and headers were not found
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev #The Xinerama library and headers were not found
```
### Start compile
open terminal in igl folder
``` bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```
