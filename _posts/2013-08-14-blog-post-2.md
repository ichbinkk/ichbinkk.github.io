To install cgal in the win10 with vs2017x64, you have to install several Dependency Libraries at first. 

 
## Package & verison  
cgal 4.13  
cmake 3.14  
qt 5.12.3  
boost 1.70.0 

## Steps ##
### 1. Qt  
First of all, download the [qt5](http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/) in the latest version and i choosed 5.12.3.Then install as following steps.Just make sure you have clicked msvc2017x64 and scriptsTool in install components options. Add C:\Qt\Qt5.12.3\5.12.3\msvc2017_64\bin to system path.
### 2. CMake  
Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/) in the latest version and i choosed 3.14. Someone said need add the cmake modules paths to the system. I haven't added and it still worked.
### 3. Boost  
Boost library has open resource in  
<http://www.boost.org/users/download/>  
and you can compile it to get the binary libaraies in you pc. For convenience, i downloaded the Boost(1.70.0) binary libraries in <https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/>  
Unzip the Boost to any path, then add path/to/boost/lib64-msvc-14.1 to system Path. Add *BOOST\_INCLUDEDIR* as path/to/Boost (mine is C:\local\boost\_1\_70\_0) in your system path, Add *BOOST_LIBRARYDIR* as path/to/Boost library (mine is C:\local\boost\_1\_70\_0\lib64-msvc-14.1) in your system path.
### 4. Install CGAL
- If none of the above steps goes wrong, you can begin to install CGAL libraries.Download the [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) and unzip to your pc.Please remember the path to it cause we will use it later. Add  CGAL_DIR as path/to/CGAL (mine is C:\dev\CGAL-4.13.1) and *C:\dev\CGAL-4.13.1\auxiliary\gmp\lib* in system path.
- Open CmakeGUI which you installed in step2, set the source code dir to path/to/CGAL (mine is C:/dev/CGAL-4.13.1), build the binaries dir to path wherever you like.(mine is C:\dev\CGAL-4.13.1\build).Then click the configure button and choose ___vs2017 win64___. If there is no errors shown in screen, click build button.  
- Open the ***.sln*** file with ***vs2017 64*** in your build path you set in CmakeGUI, and build all projects both in debug and release mode.  

Congratulations, you are finished to build the CGAL
binary libraries in the path/to/build/bin. For convenience, you should add this path to system path to use the CGAL in projects you like.  

## Install CGAL demos and examples
For now, you maybe wanna build the CGAL demos and examples to learn how to use CGAL libraries.It still need  additional several Dependency Libraries. I just had installed Eigen3, TBB, Metis to build _Polyhedron_ demo. Maybe you want to install all Dependency Libraries and I admire your courage and endurance. The instructions are similar as belows.  
### 1. Eigen3  
Download the [Eigen3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library and unzip in anywhere you like.Set *EIGEN3\_DIR* as path/to/Eigen3 (mine D:\Env\eigen3) in system path.  
### 2. TBB  
Download [TBB](https://github.com/intel/tbb/releases) and unzip in anywhere you like.Add path/to/tbb/bin/intel64/vc14 (D:\Env\tbb2019\bin\intel64\vc14),add *TBB\_ARCH\_PLATFORM* as *intel64\vc14* and  *TBBROOT* as path/to/tbb (D:\Env\tbb2019) to system path. **Notes**: No matter what your computer CPU is Intel or AMD, it all worked. Besides, AMD YES!  
### 3. Metis  
Download [Metis](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download) and unzip in *D:\Env\metis-5.1.0*. Using CmakeGUI to build the Metis binary files in *D:\Env\metis-5.1.0\build*.  
I found the module which set to find the Metis libraries have many mistakes in 4.13.1 version. So I rewrited it as simple as possible in C:\dev\CGAL-4.13.1\cmake\modules\FindMETIS.cmake. You can download new [FindMETIS.cmake](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kitBPLU_BHbRE-c9cfAEDRD4mm460ffy) to replace the old version.Then add *METIS\_INCLUDE\_DIR* as *D:\Env\metis-5.1.0\include* and "METIS\_LIBRARY\_DIR" as *D:\Env\metis-5.1.0\build\libmetis\Release* to system path.

If you have any question or problem in above steps, you can make comment on my website. I will check it sometimes and reply.
